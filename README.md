# Flintstone Project

A low-level C-based simulation of a file system and shell environment. Designed for educational use, the Flintstone Project mimics disk operations, command parsing, and file I/O behaviors from scratch.

## üìö Overview

The Flintstone Project is a modular operating systems educational project written in C. It simulates key file system components and includes an interactive shell interface. This sandbox is ideal for learning how disks, file systems, and shells interact at the systems programming level.

### Batch Shortcut

Instead of using `-cd`, you may directly run:

```bash
./BPForbes_Flinstone_Shell <volume> <rows> <nibbles> [-y | -n]
```

Example:

```bash
./BPForbes_Flinstone_Shell mydisk 8 4 -y
```

Equivalent to: `-cd mydisk 8 4 -y`

## üñ•Ô∏è Example Shell Session

```shell
mkdir projects
cd projects
touch file.txt
write file.txt "Hello Flintstone!"
read file.txt
ls
```
